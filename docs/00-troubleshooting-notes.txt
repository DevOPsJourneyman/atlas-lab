Step 1:
Confirm ip set up on both nodes in /etc/network/interfaces
Issue** Assigned IP addressses to vmbr10 are acting as host interfaces
, not a bridge fabric
There should be no ip address as it conflicts with 
pfsense.
First fix try 
    remove ip address from vmbr10 on both nodes
Done

Step 2:
Next step - set up vxlan sdn

Create sdn zone
    Type: vxlan
    add ip addresses
    mtu: 1450
    nodes: atlas01 + atlas02
Create Vnet inside the sdn
    Name: vnet10
    tag: 10
    Vxlan id auto Assigned

    SDN > status > apply

    ON the pfsense vm > hardware > network device
        Bridge > update to vnet10
        click apply and reboot vm

    configure pfsense interfaces
    Lan 10.0.0.1/24 + enable DCHP
Step 3:

Test > Does atlas VM ping correctly? 
    Intially, no. 
    Change nic to vnet10. Ping again.  Success
    pfsense ping check
    lan gateway check
    access laptop check
    Repeat test on atlas02 vm
    change nic to vnet10
    update the netplan to DCHP
    sudo netplan generate
    sudo netplan apply
    correct DHCP IP Assigned
    ping to gateway, pfsense and laptop Success
    unable to ping to atlas01 vm
    atlas01 vm can ping to atlas02 vm

Step 4: 

investigate why only one direction ping
    also, why can they ping the local Lan? 
    both vms have 10.0.0.1 as default gateway
    Your VXLAN interface exists, but it has no VTEP peers and no group.
    checking each node - ip -d link show type vxlan
    local address is missing → it says nothing after id 10.
opensense is only running on livecd; need to install
    settings reset after a reboot
    installed by logging console as installer
    seems to have sorted the lost network settings after reboot
back to one direction ping
    vmbr0 bridge port on atlas01 had nic0, changed to eno1
atlas01 offline. investigate
    nic0 is valid. restored nic0 as the bridge port to resolve
    systemctl status networking - showed the error
back to one direction ping
    Bingo!  one vm is win11 and windows defender firewall
    was turned on.  temp disable allowed for ping to work as intended
    turned on firewall and created a new rule to allow icmpv4 ping
    ping is working in both directions now.
